# GeoQuiz
The GeoQuiz app from the Big Nerd Ranch book on Android Programming

The app quizzes you on your Geologocial knowledge and presents toasts messages
letting you know if you are correct or incorrect, then gives a score at the end.

This was the first app I made for Android. Since doing this project from the book, I've decided to move away from strictly Android development to React Native.

# Layout
Each branch is a different challenge from the textbook

# Sample of the running app
